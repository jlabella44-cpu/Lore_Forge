"""book dossier: structured research blob per book

Revision ID: 0008_book_dossier
Revises: 0007_image_asset_cache
Create Date: 2026-04-17

Adds a single nullable JSON column `dossier` to books. Built once per book
on first generate (cached), threaded into every downstream creative LLM
stage so scene prompts can cite concrete setting, motifs, and tonal keys
instead of falling back to genre-generic "dark cinematic" mush.
